/* NOTE: The accessData function could not be imported into and accessed from the modal.js 
when the function was placed in the main.js module. It is unclear what caused the error, 
but it may be somehow related to the issue of 'circular dependency' and the import chain 
when importing modules in JS. 
When placing the accessData function directly in the modal.js module and accessing the data 
from inside the modal.js module, the function works. To avoid the import chain problem 
(and to keep the modal.js module free of data), the accessData function is instead placed in 
the modalData.js module and imported into the modal.js module from where it is called.
